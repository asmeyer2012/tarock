## Below is our custom event loop.
## Because this particular server runs the different daemons using the "thread" server type,
## there is no built in way of combining the different event loops and server sockets.
## We have to write our own multiplexing server event loop, and dispatch the requests
## to the server that they belong to.
## It is a bit silly to do it this way because the choice for a threaded server type
## has already been made-- so you could just as well run the different daemons' request loops
## each in their own thread and avoid writing this integrated event loop altogether.
## But for the sake of example we write out our own loop:

try:
  while True:
    print(time.asctime(), "Waiting for requests...")
    ## create sets of the socket objects we will be waiting on
    ## (a set provides fast lookup compared to a list)
    nameserverSockets = set(nameserverDaemon.sockets)
    pyroSockets = set(pyrodaemon.sockets)
    rs = [broadcastServer] ## only the broadcast server is directly usable as a select() object
    rs.extend(nameserverSockets)
    rs.extend(pyroSockets)
    sleepTimeSec = 10
    rs, _, _ = select.select(rs, [], [], sleepTimeSec)
    eventsForNameserver = []
    eventsForDaemon = []
    for s in rs:
      if s is broadcastServer:
        print("Broadcast server received a request")
        broadcastServer.processRequest()
      elif s in nameserverSockets:
        eventsForNameserver.append(s)
      elif s in pyroSockets:
        eventsForDaemon.append(s)
    if eventsForNameserver:
      print("Nameserver received a request")
      nameserverDaemon.events(eventsForNameserver)
    if eventsForDaemon:
      print("Daemon received a request")
      pyrodaemon.events(eventsForDaemon)
